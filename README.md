# LabResources

This repo will host resources for lab sessions, including software installation instructions, and most importantly, **all assignment Jupyter notebooks**.  Clone the repo to a location you'll maintain throughout the course (not inside other course org repos, e.g., not inside your local copy of your course personal repo—the repo you'll create for Lab01, named according to your GitHub username).  You'll only need to clone this repo *once*.  Afterward, running `git pull` at the start of each lab session (in a terminal opened to work in your local `LabResources` folder) will update your local copy of the repo to contain the latest lab content, including the latest assignment.

Assignments will typically be provided as a Jupyter notebook named `AssignmentXX.ipynb` (where `XX` is a number) that provides explanatory information along with problem descriptions, and a solutions template, `SolutionsXX,ipynb`, that contains only the problem descriptions.  You should **copy the solutions template to your own course GitHub org repo**, and edit that copy to complete the assignment, as described below.
